* 3.0.1 May 13 2017
- Include netFetchDelete in MANIFEST.in and setup.py

* 3.0.0 May 13 2017
- Compatible format with 2.0 series, but drops support for 1.x series (base64
encoding). Use 2.0.3, fetch with --old-format, and save without that flag to
convert.
- Compatible with IndexedRedis > 5.0.0 and < 7.0.0. May work with 4.x series
too if lzma compression is commented out, but that's not the official release.
- Support for compression. --compress can be specified, or --compress=MODE
when using netfetchPut . Default is lzma, which is provided on python3 but
requires an external module on python2. Alternates MODE can be lzma/xz ,
gzip/gz , bzip2/bz2. Only need to be specified on Put, Get will automatically
detect and decompress (if required).
- Some code cleanups
- Add netFetchDelete which will allow deleting stored files

* 2.0.3 May 13 2017
- Update the 2.0.x requirements.txt to require IndexedRedis < 4.0.0, to
prevent breakage with backwards-incompatible changes on newer IndexedRedis.

Next version will update to latest IndexedRedis.


* 2.0.2 Dec 29 2015
- Cleanup README.rst a bit and update a help string that didn't make much sense.

* 2.0.1 Release    Dec 28 2015
- *BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE* directly store as binary instead of using
base64 encoding/decoding, for vast speedups and space improvements. See README
for more information, including how to use old format.
- Require at least IndexedRedis 2.9.0


* 1.0.0 prerelease Sep 30 2015
- Initial Prerelease
